# FPGA Synthesizable Verilog Modules

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Verilog modules that are synthesizable on FPGA. The modules are derived from detailed examples and guidelines discussed in the "Computer aided Digital System Design" course.

## Contents
The repository includes Verilog files for the following modules:
- Adders (Full, Half, etc.)
- Shift Registers (Shift Left, Shift Right, Dynamic Shift, etc.)
- Counters (Up, Down, Up/Down, etc.)
- Multiplexers and Decoders
- Finite State Machines (FSM)
- Memory Elements (RAM, ROM)
- Arithmetic Units (Multipliers, Accumulators)
- And many others

Each module is provided as a `.v` file that can be directly used or modified for your specific requirements.

## Usage
To use these modules, clone this repository and import the desired Verilog files into your design tool. These modules are written in a way that they can be synthesized on various FPGA platforms.
